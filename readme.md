# Full Stack Deep Learning Fall 2022 Labs

Welcome!

As part of Full Stack Deep Learning 2022, we will incrementally develop a complete deep learning codebase to understand the content of handwritten paragraphs.

We will use the modern stack of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch-Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/)

We will use the main workhorses of DL today: CNNs and Transformers

We will manage our experiments using what we believe to be the best tool for the job: [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/)

We will set up a quality assurance and continuous integration system for our codebase using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)

We will package up the prediction system as a REST API and deploy it as a Docker container on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

We will set up monitoring that alerts us to potential issues in our model using [Gantry](https://gantry.io/)
